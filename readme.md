#Do I Need An Umbrella?
----------------------------
Hopefully the answer is no, but if you do this little app can tell you.

I was inspired by the neat [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io) API and I decided to make a really, really simple weather app with one purpose. I decided knowing when I need an umbrella was a good start.

Feel free to fork this repo and do something fun with it, but if you do get your own Forecast.io [API key](https://developer.darkskyapp.com/). It's free!
